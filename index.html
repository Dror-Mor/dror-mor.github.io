<h1>Bread Pudding Philosophy</h1>
<div>
Bread is one of the most common groceries you could find at home. Many of us keep it while it's fresh and then just throw it away when it's dry.
<br /> What if I told you, you could make one of the <b>tastiest</b> dishes from something so unappealing?
</div>

<div>
  As a way of life, I believe we should pay close attention to the items we discard on a daily basis. are they recyclable? Can we find another use for them? Is it really the end of their lives?
</div>

<h2>What Do We Need?</h2>
<p>
  All you need are the following ingredients:
  <ul>
    <li>Old, dry bread</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Raisins</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Cinnamon</li>

  </ul>
</p>
If you have all of these ingredients, you're in for a real treat.

I feel like the over site is obviously nicer looking. in mine there's a long list of titles, whether than sections top to bottom as well as right to left. <br>
the information is centered and the colors give it a more inviting look. </p>
