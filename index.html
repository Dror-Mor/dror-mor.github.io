<h1>Bread Pudding Philosophy</h1>
<div>
Bread is one of the most common groceries you could find at home. Many of us keep it while it's fresh and then just throw it away when it's dry.
<br /> What if I told you, you could make one of the <b>tastiest</b> dishes from something so unappealing?

<div>
  As a way of life, I believe we should pay close attention to the items we discard on a daily basis. are they recyclable? Can we find another use for them? Is it really the end of their lives?
